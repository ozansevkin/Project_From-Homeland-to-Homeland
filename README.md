- This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees.

- It has been coded to be adaptive on popular screen sizes from 320 px to 1280+ px.

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/1zCYcflj6BJx5VqOvXU9nb/Sprint-3-From-Homeland-to-Homeland-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1) file has been used as the design spec.

- Design included 3 different layouts for 1280px, 768px and 320px and hover states. 2 breakpoints has been implemented for smooth transition between these layouts.
